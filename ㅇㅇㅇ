  <h1>PedalPal: A Guide to Guitar Effects</h1>

  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>My project is a website that introduces different types of guitar effect pedals. Users can browse pedal categories, view descriptions, and watch demo videos.</p>

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Official websites of pedal brands (BOSS, Strymon, etc.)</li>
    <li>YouTube demo channels (JHS Pedals, That Pedal Show)</li>
    <li>Web development tools (React.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Details</h2>
  <p>
    This website will showcase various guitar pedals, organized by type (like distortion, delay, reverb). Each pedal will have a description, image, and video or audio demo.
    Users will be able to filter pedals by type or brand, and search by name. The site will be built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.
    I may use Firebase to store data. It will be mobile-friendly and have a clean, music-inspired design.
  </p>

  <h2>Overlap with Other Work</h2>
  <p>No, this project is only for this class. (Professor’s name goes here.)</p>

  <h2>Project Goals</h2>

  <h3>GOOD Outcome</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A working site with a list of pedals and basic info</li>
    <li>Simple and responsive design</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>BETTER Outcome</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Filter/search features</li>
    <li>Embedded YouTube demos</li>
    <li>Mobile-friendly layout</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>BEST Outcome</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>User accounts for saving favorite pedals</li>
    <li>Admin page to add/edit pedals</li>
    <li>Audio comparison tool</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Plan content and collect pedal data (images, info, videos). Set up the project with React.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Build main pages (home, pedal list). Start applying styles with Tailwind.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Add filtering, search, and media embedding.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Improve design and mobile experience. Try adding user login if time allows.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 5:</strong> Final testing, polish, and deployment. Prepare presentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Need to Learn</h2>
  <p>I’ll need to learn more about Firebase, React hooks, and how to embed video/audio effectively.</p>
