  <h1>PedalPal: A Guide to Guitar Effects</h1>

  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>My project is a website that introduces different types of guitar effect pedals. Users can browse pedal categories, view descriptions, and watch demo videos.</p>

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Official websites of pedal brands (BOSS, Strymon, etc.)</li>
    <li>YouTube demo channels (JHS Pedals, That Pedal Show)</li>
    <li>Web development tools (React.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Details</h2>
  <p>
    This website will showcase various guitar pedals, organized by type (like distortion, delay, reverb). Each pedal will have a description, image, and video or audio demo.
    Users will be able to filter pedals by type or brand, and search by name. The site will be built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.
    I may use Firebase to store data. It will be mobile-friendly and have a clean, music-inspired design.
